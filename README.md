odin project on landing page
This is a good recipe landing page, improving on the previous food recipe website with pages that I was working on as my first odin project.
This landing page has four sections

Section one is called the header container
The second is the Information section
The third is the quote section where the testimonial goes 
And then the last is the call to action
I also imputed a footer as required by Odinproject

Tell me, have I made progress?
